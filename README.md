Adventures of Beans is sa small, opensource, CYOA/Choose Your Own Adventure game engine, intended to work for those less tech-inclined, functioning on nothing but python and .txt documents.
This version is as simple as it gets -- put .txt files in the "Story" folder, and navigate between them based on user choices. Although it will reviece more polish in future, that's as complex as this branch will get, and (in theory) any further updates will not affect funtionality (ie. all updates will be backwards-compatible, formatting-wise)

Writing tutorials are included in the .txt files, run the program and the narrator, Beans, will walk you through everything you need to know to write stories, or feel free to open them yourself.
