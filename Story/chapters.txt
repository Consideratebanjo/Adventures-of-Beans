This is a page. It is part of the "Story" chapter (output to make this clearer is planned in further updates)
You can put other pages and chapters into folders, and even subfolders for subchapters, but it requires some specific formatting (see the formatting page for more info)
You can have as many pages, chapters, and subchapters as you like -- in theory, the program is very lightweight, only opening one file/page at a time, and closing the file as soon as a new page is selected.
