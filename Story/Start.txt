Tutorial for authors:
this build is barebones, and can't do very much compared to my plans for this project.
All it can do is read to the user, present choices, and look for those choices' corresponding documents. 
Run the program yourself for an example of the output and compare to the formatting in these documents.
The .py file must be placed in the same folder as the "Story" folder, and will always first open "Start" in the "Story" folder (all file & folder searching is case-sensitive)
