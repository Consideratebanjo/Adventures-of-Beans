This is a page in a subchapter!
Try opening the "formatting.txt" file elsewhere (from your file explorer) to see how the choice pointed here.
For subchapters/subchapter pages, the choice pointer must be {/subchapter(/...)/file} (not including the curly brackets) not including the ".txt", with the "(/...)" signifying you must walk the program through each subfolder.

To return to the tutorial start, input 1.
To read about chapters, input 2.
To return to the formatting page, input 3.

However, for some reason the choices are not being presented for traveling from this page. More testing required.
Until fixed, ideally just don't use subchapters, and/or if you're able to asctertain what's going wrong, feel free to make a pull request. If you know what's going wrong in more detail but aren't techy, please contact me, either on github (Consideratebanjo) or by email (aleppleton@gmail.com)
